However, this algorithm is not efficient and has exponential time complexity. 
The number of iterations in the for loop is not O(n), but rather O(2^(log n)), 
which is exponential in the number of bits in the binary representation of n. 
This is because the number of iterations is determined by the size of the input 
in bits, not the value of the input itself. 

This means that the algorithm is not a member of the complexity class P, which 
contains all problems that can be solved in polynomial time. In fact, it is 
believed that there is no polynomial-time algorithm for primality testing, and 
that the problem is in the complexity class NP, but not in P unless P = NP.
